# 2022 ANS Student Conference Scientific Computing Workshop
# According to all known laws
#of aviation,

  
#there is no way a bee
#should be able to fly.

  
#Its wings are too small to get
#its fat little body off the ground.

  
#The bee, of course, flies anyway

     
#because bees don't care
#what humans think is impossible.
